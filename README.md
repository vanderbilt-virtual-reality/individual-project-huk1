1)	Why did I make this? My intention or motivation.

a.	Personally, I love the experience that horror movies give to the watcher. Although I have not yet experienced a horror movie in 3D, I believe that the experience can only be amplified if the user was experiencing it in VR. Other genres are unable to elicit the same reactions or give the adrenaline rushes that horror can. When someone can run through my game and genuinely get a rush from playing it, I feel very satisfied. Additionally, I have always wanted to create an immersive 3D game as a passion project, and this project was a perfect starting point. I put a lot of time designing the environment, adding props in a strategic way in order to cause the most fear in the player. It was also very enjoyable to have people test my project, get their feedback, and iterate on my designs.

2)	Why is VR a good medium to achieve my goals?

a.	Oftentimes, to get reactions and the full excitement from horror, you would have to experience it in person, which may be very dangerous, or experience it as a bystander. Experiencing it as a bystander places a physical distance between your senses and a screen, and that loses some of the proximity and immersion. However, a VR headset places the player right into the world, and that really helps when trying to deliver a feeling of dread and unease. Seeing your character being chased by a monster is much less unnerving then having you yourself being chased by that monster, especially if you can physically turn around and see that monster gaining on you. Additionally, the scary models I placed into the world and the foliage around the maze’s paths are best appreciated in the VR first person perspective.

3)	Critiques or limitations of VR for my goals?

a.	I felt that the scare from being caught by the monster is not scary enough for losing to feel like it has any consequences. In further iterations of this game, I aim to make a properly fleshed out jumpscare in order to “punish” getting caught by the monster. Currently, VR makes the jumpscare wonky if you can try to look away from the monster as it happens, so it was not included in the final product.
